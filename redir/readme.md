Link passthrough i made in like 5 minutes ~~and 1 stack overflow visit~~ for Discord's upcoming advanced markdown features, which brings inline links to the definitely awesome and bugfree chat app. And surprise surprise, it only supports https links!! This is intended to bypass this restriction.

To use, pass the protocol link you want to use as the `url` parameter, like so: 
```
https://notsuu.github.io/redir?url=calculator://
```
